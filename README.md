### Information for evaluation participants

#### Overview of the evaluation

The evaluation consists of completing three tasks in order to gauge the effectiveness of our Style Checker web extension. For each task you will be asked to make a recording of your screen, to be used in our post-test analysis. The evaluation concludes with a short questionnaire.

The expected time to complete this evaluation is approximately 15 minutes.

5. [Task 3](#task-3)

##### Steps of the evaluation

The following is the steps of the evaluation. Follow these steps in order to complete the evaluation.

1. Familiarize yourself with the Style Checker extension, as described [here](#basics-of-the-style-checker-extension).

2. Spend some time experimenting with the extension to get a grasp of its behavior.

3. Perform the three tasks, as described [here](#evaluation-tasks). Be prepared to record your screen as you complete them, using Zoom on windows or the built in screen recording feature on MacOS (cmd + shift + 5). You can record your screen using Zoom by entering a Zoom room by yourself, screen sharing the browser window, and then recording the Zoom meeting. **For privacy reasons, you only need to record the browser screen itself.** After completing each task, jot down any notes you have regarding how the task went.

5. Finally, once finished with the three tasks, complete  [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYSsjs3EtIzK4Jv2TiSwFV0p2UYDVXeDA2JUab2quzATNSRA/viewform?usp=sf_link) questionnaire on your experience with the extension and any final thoughts. The full link is below.
